In May 2022 we had the pleasure of completely refurbishing the kitchen in the village hall Great Holland which is particularly close to my heart as it is my local village hall.

We carried out a complete strip back to brickwork, re plastered, painted and ceramic tiled the entire room.

We updated the plumbing within the kitchen as the existing was very old and outdated.

We then installed a beautifully fresh Howdens Joinery gloss cream Clerkenwell handless kitchen with a new dual fuel range oven for users of the hall to enjoy and utilise cooking facilities for parties and functions etc.

There is plenty of storage and the kitchen is now brighter and easier to keep clean thus making the kitchen more enjoyable and easy to use for future hirers.
