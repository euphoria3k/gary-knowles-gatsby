    I offer a unique service where as I can offer the complete installation
    package including the kitchen itself, the electrics, the tiling, the Gas
    Safe work, even the plastering and you receive just the one bill at the end
    of the install. No paper trail of different invoices & bills etc just the
    one to cover all. I have been project managing kitchen refurbishment
    installations now for over 10 years and have some of the best tradesmen in
    the business at my service.

        Great friendly, professional and accommodating service from start to
        finish including planning and recommending at the outset to attention to
        detail at the end to make sure we were completely satisfied and happy
        with our new kitchen and downstairs wc.

        We would reccomend Gary to anyone for the fitting of kitchens etc
        Nothing is too much trouble and we loved Gary's exuberance and
        positivity to make anything we wanted happen.

        We are really pleased with the work Gary carried out in our kitchen
        recently. We had a new worktop, sink and taps fitted. The work was
        completed in a reasonable time and with minimum disruption. They even
        cleaned up the mess after! The work was done to a very high standard and
        looks amazing. I would 100% use this company again.
    - title: Excellent kitchen fitter

        Brilliant experience using Gary and his team! Very professional and
        friendly guys! We were kept informed about everything at every stage and
        everything was completed in the time Gary had originally set out. We
        couldn't be happier with the design and quality of our new kitchen and
        would 100% recommend.
    - title: Simply the Best
      description: >
        We recently moved into our new home into a new area. We have heard some
        horror stories of rogue builders so were very nervous about choosing the
        right kitchen fitter. We need not have worried. Gary set our minds at
        ease from the very first meeting, where we discussed our vision to the
        installation. We did good,to say we are happy is an understatement. Gary
        produced everything he promised and more. Our kitchen looks incredible.
        Gary and the team are professional and efficient and we can't recommend
        Gary highly enough. Thank you Gary for everything, we are absolutely
        thrilled.

        I recently had a new kitchen installed which also included plastering,
        electrical work and decorating.

        We received exceptional service with all work undertaken with an
        excellent eye to detail.

        We would recommend Gary to anybody who is considering undertaking the
        thought of a new kitchen.
    - title: Excellent team reliable and professional

        Excellent team who transformed the kitchen in our old village hall.

        They took everything back to bare bricks and did a lot of tidying up old
        pipework's and electrical cables. 

        Highly recommend their work.

        I honestly couldn't fault them in anyway, very professional, friendly
        and genuine guys.

        The work they carried out is just beyond amazing and they kept us in the
        loop the whole time tackling any problems that came up during the
        process head on without flaws.

        Id recommend them to anyone in the future and will 100% be using them
        for our next home. 5 stars.
