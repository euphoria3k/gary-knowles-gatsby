I am a local tradesman & business owner serving the Tendring District & surrounding areas.

I offer full or part service covering all aspects of installation from removal of existing units & accessories to complete installation of new units, including Plastering, Ceramic Floor Tiling & Wall Tiling & Laminate flooring. I also offer fully qualified electrical work & Gas Safe work, all which comes with certification upon completion.

I have a trade accounts with Howdens Joinery & Magnet who supply high quality kitchens to the trade only, thus enabling professionals such as ourselves to install beautiful kitchens with a first class result. 

I also have top end suppliers of replacement kitchen doors which are very competitively priced indeed.

I am reliable, trustworthy and organised and communication is a key part in the way in which my team & I work providing customers with regular feedback throughout the duration of any installation however big the job may be. I also take great pride in my work and treat each customers property as if it were my own.

I work alongside various other trades, including Electrical, Gas Safe and 1st class Plasterers who are all leading professionals in their qualified trade and regular members of my installation team.

Although there are several members of my team at times you still get one invoice and pay the one final payment on completion of your install as the above mentioned professionals are sub-contracted & vetted by myself.

I would welcome the opportunity to earn your trust and deliver you the best service in the industry.
